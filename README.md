# Conway's Mini Game of Life

Devised by John Conway in 1970, the Game of Life is a zero player game 


## How to Play

The Game of Life starts with an initial pattern of cells created by you - this is known as the seed. 

Each cell has a total of 8 neighbours. Cells evolve over time through an infinite series of steps known as generations. During each generation, cells are checked against a core set of rules to see whether they should live or die.


For Live Cells:
* < 2 live neighbours - death!
* 2 or 3 live neighbours - survival!
* > 3 live neighbours - death!

For Dead Cells:
* 2 or 3 live neighbours - comes to life!
